Figure out a way to show recent activity correctly in the latest chapter section and in the story view (latest chapter has \n showing.)

In the user profile, add possibility to change theme preference.
Add a Display name to the user profile. The motivation for this is so the user can e.g. type in their character name.
User should be able to change their password.

Add so that the user is automatically logged out after inactivity time or upon closing the browser.

In the admin panel, instead of showing email of users, show their username.
- This should be done to minimise Admins exposure and access to to users email.
- When the user has not yet registered, a placeholder should be in the place of the username.
- This needs to be thought over.. There probably needs to be some way for the Admin to differentiate who they have added, even when the person hasnt registered yet.
