add a "rumor" section to the quest page.

When going to the "LocationsPage" and pressing "Show Places Within" they are automatically collapsed immediately... They should be able to be expanded. 

When adding a new NPC, make it its own page, so that all the NPCPage content doesnt show underneath the adding part. 

Fix Navigation First:

Improve the breadcrumb navigation on all pages

Improve Core User Experience:

Add proper loading states
Implement error handling
Add proper progress tracking persistence

Implement a database solution so users can type in content from the front end.
