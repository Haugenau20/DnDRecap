# Firebase Authentication User Deletion Options

## Client-Side Limitations

There's a fundamental security limitation in Firebase: **client-side code can only delete a user's own account, not other users' accounts**. This is why my implementation only removes the Firestore data but not the Authentication record.

The Firebase Authentication JavaScript SDK only provides:
- `currentUser.delete()` - For users to delete their own account
- No API to delete another user's Authentication account from client-side code

## Your Options

1. **Manual Deletion**: Yes, currently you would need to manually delete users through the Firebase Console Authentication section.

2. **Firebase Cloud Functions**: This is absolutely a viable solution for your application and is the recommended approach for admin-user deletion.

## How Firebase Cloud Functions Would Work

This approach is entirely viable for your application and is a common pattern:

1. **Create a Cloud Function**:
```javascript
// Using Firebase Admin SDK in a Cloud Function
const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
admin.initializeApp();

exports.deleteUser = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  // Security check - only admins can delete users
  const callerUid = context.auth.uid;
  const callerData = await admin.firestore().collection('users').doc(callerUid).get();
  
  if (!callerData.exists || !callerData.data().isAdmin) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('permission-denied', 'Only admins can delete users');
  }
  
  // Get user details to delete from Firestore
  const userEmail = data.email;
  const userQuery = await admin.firestore()
    .collection('users')
    .where('email', '==', userEmail.toLowerCase())
    .limit(1)
    .get();
  
  if (userQuery.empty) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('not-found', 'User not found');
  }
  
  const userDoc = userQuery.docs[0];
  const uid = userDoc.id;
  
  // Delete from Authentication
  await admin.auth().deleteUser(uid);
  
  // Delete from Firestore (similar to your current implementation)
  // ...Firestore deletion logic here
  
  return { success: true };
});
```

2. **Call from your client**:
```typescript
// In your client code
import { getFunctions, httpsCallable } from "firebase/functions";

const deleteUser = async (email: string) => {
  const functions = getFunctions();
  const deleteUserFunction = httpsCallable(functions, 'deleteUser');
  return deleteUserFunction({ email });
};

// Then in your AdminPanel
await deleteUser(email);
```

## Is it Worth Implementing?

For your current application, it depends on your priorities:

1. **Simple Solution (Current)**: Users cannot log in if removed from `allowedUsers`, but Authentication records remain.

2. **Complete Solution (Cloud Functions)**: Full user deletion, but requires:
   - Setting up Firebase Cloud Functions
   - Deploying server-side code
   - Slightly higher Firebase usage costs

If you plan to scale your application and want proper user management, I'd recommend implementing the Cloud Functions approach. It's a clean, secure way to handle admin operations and follows Firebase best practices.
